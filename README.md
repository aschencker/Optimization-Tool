# Optimization-Tool

Previously the Saluki Student Investment fund used Excel for the optimization process. I built an optimization tool in R that automates the optimization processes by pulling data with the Bloomberg API. Then Missing returns are predicted with Lasso regression. Next the constrained quadratic programming problem is solved for. Then the tool determines the number of shares to be bought and sold using integer programming. Included in this repository is the presentation 
I gave to memebers of the Saluki Student Investment Fund In order to get the new optimization tool approved.
